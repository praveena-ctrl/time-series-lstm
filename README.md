# time-series-lstm
This repository  implementation of a sophisticated time series forecasting solution using an Encoder-Decoder Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network augmented with a custom Attention Mechanism. This project moves beyond traditional methods like ARIMA and simple RNNs to tackle complex, synthetic, multi-seasonal, and heteroscedastic time series data.
